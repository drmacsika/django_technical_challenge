# Technical Assignment

We decided to build a mobile application for our customers, so that they can order our products using their phones. Your goal is to build the backend for this application. 


### Requirements 
* Customers may exchange their username and password for an authentication token
* Customers may see a paginated list of products. Each product in the list should have the following details: `id`, `name`, `price`, and `quantity in stock`
* Customers may order the products they need
* Number of products in stock should decrease after an order is made
* Customers may see their history of orders.

### Technical details
* Django 4.x (any modules, any data structures)
* API only, no need for UI
* Please host your repository on Github or Gitlab and either make it public and provide the link for review.

### Bonus points
* Provide deployment instructions for one of the major providers (GCP, AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc). No need for actual configuration scripts: 2-3 sentences is enough.
* We expect that the assignment takes around 8 hours. Do as much as you can within this timeframe and provide a description of what else you'd like to do but were unable to due to limited time.
